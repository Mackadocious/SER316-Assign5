Design Pattern Plans:

Because the types of animals will all be very similar classes I plan to 
use the Compolsite design pattern to group the animal objects into a single
object. 

I plan to use the builder pattern to create farms and assign different attributes to each farm.

I will be using the suggestion to use the mediator pattern to create ticks, where currency will be generated
along with keeping track of animal tasks and growing crops.
